I very much enjoy engaging and supporting the engineering community by:

- Speaking at conferences and events
- Initiating and leading events internally and externally
- Writing articles, tutorials and creating screencasts
- Contributing to open source projects
- Hosting podcasts


NYCHTML5
---

**Meetup Event:**<br>
The [NYCHTML5 Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/nychtml5) was founded in 2011 by a good friend (and Google Chrome Dev Advocate), [Domenic Denicola](https://domenic.me). About a year after starting the group, he handed it off to me and my co-organizer, [John K Paul](https://twitter.com/johnkpaul). Under our stewardship, [the group has grown to well over 2400 members](http://www.meetup.com/nychtml5/members/) and has held over 30 events (many [recorded by Hakka Labs](https://www.hakkalabs.co/meetups/nychtml5)). We are very proud of the inclusive community we have fostered and we are regularly approached by first time speakers wishing to present to the group.

**Broadcast:**<br>
We also started a complimentary [broadcast series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxGLihicw5Wp5fjDjAJfpcp02OBS8X--C) (video/audio podcast) where we follow up with our presenters and dig a little deeper into the topics they shared at the meetup.

**Other Events:**<br>
In addition to the monthly meetups, we have held many hacker hours and other special events.
