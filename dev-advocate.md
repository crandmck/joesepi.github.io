Summary
---

I am passionate about engaging and supporting the engineering community, both internally (where I am employed) and within the larger tech world.

_I hear you like bullet points. So do I!_<br>
**Here are some of the things I do:**

- Co-organize the very successful [NYCHTML5 group](http://meetup.com/nychtml5)
- [Speak at conferences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKOC5H7UV_U), events and on panels
- Initiate and lead events internally and externally
- Write articles and tutorials
- Host podcasts
- Create screencasts

Over the years, I have been involved in a number of open source projects: [JSCS](http://jscs.info/), [BeFF](https://github.com/behance/beff), [nbd.js](https://github.com/behance/nbd.js), [nvd3](http://nvd3.org/), [Rupert](https://github.com/RupertJS), [Flip Flops](https://github.com/DavidSouther/flipflops), [MEAN Cookbook](https://github.com/DavidSouther/mean-cookbook), [Github Flow](https://github.com/github-flow)



NYCHTML5
---

**Meetup Event:**<br>
Founded in 2011 by a good friend (and Google Chrome Dev Advocate), [Domenic Denicola](https://domenic.me), and handed off to me and my co-organizer, [John K Paul](https://twitter.com/johnkpaul), a year or so later, [the group has grown to well over 2400 members](http://www.meetup.com/nychtml5/members/). We are very proud of the inclusive community we have fostered and we are regularly approached by first time speakers wishing to present to the group.

**Broadcast:**<br>
We have also started a complimentary [broadcast series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxGLihicw5Wp5fjDjAJfpcp02OBS8X--C) where we follow up with our presenter and dig a little deeper into the topics that they had presented on. We expect to continue this and publish it as an audio/video podcast.

**Other Events:**<br>
In addition to the monthly meetups, we have held many hacker hours and other special events.

Adobe/Behance
---

Upon joining [Behance](http://be.net), I immediately took up the Dev Advocacy torch. In addition to replatforming the [dev blog](http://dev.behancetech.net) and forming a group to help support the dev rel activities, I have also been developing relationships with other external groups like [Uncubed](http://uncubed.com), [Hakka Labs](https://www.hakkalabs.co/companies/behance), [DevPost](http://devpost.com/teams/behance), [Fullstack Academy](http://www.fullstackacademy.com/), [Grace Hopper Academy](http://www.gracehopper.com/), [ScriptEd](https://www.scripted.org/) and more.

Some accomplishments:

- Created the [BehanceTech Medium publication](medium.com/behancetech) and serve as editor
- Lead the internal tech talk series
- Speak at a number of public events on behalf of Behance/Adobe
<!--  - Led the effort to formalize Behance's open source practices -->
- Mentor other engineers on writing and speaking in public
- Uncubed Video explainer
- Uncubed Hiring Panel (ADD PHOTOS SOMEWHERE? A BLOG POST?)
- Uncubed Year-end event
- Engage students at college/university events
