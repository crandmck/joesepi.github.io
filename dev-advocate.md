Summary
---

I am passionate about engaging and supporting the development community both internally (where I am employed), and within the larger tech world.

At a high level, here are some of the ways in which I engage with the community, past and present:

- Co-organizer of the very successful [NYCHTML5 group](http://meetup.com/nychtml5)
- [Speaking at conferences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKOC5H7UV_U), events and on panels
- Initiating and leading events internally and externally
- Writing articles and tutorials
- Hosting podcasts
- Creating screencasts

Over the years, I have been involved in a number of open source projects: JSCS, BeFF, nbd.js, nvd3, Rupert, Flip Flops, MEANfaq, Github Flow



NYCHTML5

**Meetup Event:**<br>
Founded in 2011 by a good friend (and Google Chrome Dev Advocate), Domenic Denicola, and handed off to me and my co-organizer, John K Paul, a year or so later, the group has grown to well over 2400 members. We are very proud of the inclusive community we have fostered and we are regularly approached by first time speakers wishing to present to the group.

**Broadcast:**<br>
We have also started a complimentary broadcast series where we follow up with our presenter and dig a little deeper into the topics that they had presented on. We expect to continue this and publish it as an audio/video podcast.

**Other Events:**<br>
 In addition to the monthly meetups, we have held many hacker hours and other events.

Adobe/Behance

Upon joining Behance, I immediately took up the Dev Advocacy torch. In addition to replatforming the dev blog and forming a group to help support the dev rel activities, I also started to build relationships with other external groups like [Uncubed](http://uncubed.com), [Hakka Labs](https://www.hakkalabs.co/companies/behance), and [DevPost](http://devpost.com/teams/behance).

Some accomplishments:
- Created a [BehanceTech Medium publication](medium.com/behancetech) and serve as editor
- Led the creation of an internal tech talk series
- Spoke at a number of public events on behalf of Behance/Adobe
- Led the effort to formalize Behance's open source practices
- Mentored other engineers on writing and speaking in public
- Uncubed Video explainer
- Uncubed Hiring Panel
- Uncubed Year-end event
