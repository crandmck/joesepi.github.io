Joe Sepi adopted the nickname in 1992 after his close friend started referring to him as such. Shortly after which, he released his first cassette with his first band (produced by the amazing, Doug Martsch from Built to Spill) and then the name was in print and took hold for sure. For many years, that was the only name known to most people who didn't know better.

Initially expecting that music would take care of him and pay his bills, Sepi worked shitty jobs and lived in basements and on couches to facilitate his obsession with writing, recording and performing music. This approach to living took him on many journeys and to many places, but it wasn't until sometime in 1998 that he would stumble into his other passion, writing code.

Sepi's roommate and bandmate, Joel Braun, got a decent job that gave him a laptop. After only moments of fiddling on this thing called the internet, he was hooked and had to know how it worked. Within a short time, he was building sites for his many bands and their record label as well as friends and local artists. When he finally met his wife, it was then that things started to get serious and before he knew it, he was working for Sears. A real career had fallen into his lap.
