I am super excited to tell you about the new music project that has begun. It goes by the name **Least Best Beast** and it is sweet.

### tl;dr

We are a rock band consisting of Patrick Conlon on bass, Mike Vlad on drums and myself doing guitar and vocals. We have been playing together since August of 2014. The sound is post-punk rock; solid trio, bitchin' riffs, just enough guitar solos. We are also mastering falling apart artfully anywhere we can, in a good way.

### More background

Since moving back to NY, I have been hungering to play some music. I was able to put together a couple one-off shows with various friends helping me out (including two appearances at PRFBBQ fests!) but still couldn't put together a regular band. After moving up to Peekskill (35mi north of the city) I was starting to think my chances were pretty slim of finding some like-minded souls to make some noise with.

Eventually, I hooked up with Patrick Conlon, the proprietor of Peekskill's wonderful Speakeasy Tattoo. He and I played together with a number of drummers, but it wasn't working for one reason or another. At a certain point, I decided to up my search and actually make a flyer (LINK). At the same time, Patrick had a new guy start at the Tattoo studio who just happened to be a really solid drummer (and maybe more importantly a super good guy.)
