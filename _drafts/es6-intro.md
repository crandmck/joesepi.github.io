I have been wanting to write about ES6/ES2015 because I love the power and convenience it provides. I had been hesitating, however, because I was wrongly assuming that everyone already knows the sweet awesomeness of ES6 and is already using it too. I am lucky that I get to work on such a great team full of really smart developers here at Behance, but it can sometimes be a bit of a bubble. I realized this when I was interviewing a dev the other day (albeit a jr dev) and he said he couldn't use ES6 until it had more brower support. I wanted to yell out "NO! BABEL! USE ES6 NOW!!!" But I didn't. I instead questioned him further to get him to realize it himself.

I realized in that moment: despite the proliferation of ES6 posts and articles, I am going to do my part by contributing to the cornicopia of resources with the hopes that more people will jump on board and take the bullet train to the future.

So let's begin with a little background and then we will start getting setup.

You may have noticed that I first mentioned ES6/2015. That is because the current standard is at ES5 (ECMAScript 5th edition) and the next version is being standardized, thus originally called ES6. Not unlike how the people have decided to remove version numbers from HTML5 (just becoming HTML), JavaScript is movin toward a rolling yearly reference to new features and so, the term ES6 has now become ES2015. This is a good move as we wont be tied to these big releases of a new version that take forever and so on. New features can be added on a rolling basis and we can advance in a more smooth bit by bit way. This is somewhat akin to the concept of semver or how browsers are updating more regularly rather than major release IE 10 => 11, for instance.

Gulp?
Babel
JSHint and JSCS

Let's look at some transpiled code

A couple basics: const and let

Next time, we'll get into some syntactical sugar sweetness, like destructuring and splats.
