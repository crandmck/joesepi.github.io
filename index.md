Hi. I'm a Sr. Software Engineer at <a href="http://be.net" target="_blank">Behance</a>/<a href="http://adobe.com" target="_blank">Adobe</a> and I play guitar and sing in the indie guitar rock juggernaut known as <a href="http://leastbestbeast.com" target="_blank">Least Best Beast</a>.\\

**As a technologist**, my two main drivers are advancing the web forward and developer relations. I have spoken at conferences and events (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKOC5H7UV_U" target="_blank">I'm fond of this talk I gave at CascadiaJS</a>), I co-organize one of NYC's more popular developer groups, <a href="http://www.nychtml5.com" target="_blank">NYC HTML5</a>, and in the past, I have worked @ <a href="http://www.nytimes.com" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>, <a href="http://www.credit-suisse.com" target="_blank">Credit Suisse</a>, <a href="http://www.iac.com" target="_blank">IAC/InterActiveCorp</a>, <a href="http://www.ogilvy.com" target="_blank">Ogilvy & Mather</a>, <a href="http://www.sears.com" target="_blank">Sears</a> and <a href="http://www.mrmessina.com" target="_blank">some others</a>.\\

**As a musician**, I've ended up with my name somewhere on the sleeve of a bunch of records, including with such bands as <a href="https://centuryrocketbuilding.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Century Rocket Building</a>, <a href="http://open.spotify.com/artist/64FGTThPGeQgCHkGyz1if8" target="_blank">Bearhawk</a>, <a href="https://foe21.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Friends of Enemies</a> and <a href="http://audio.pvxrecords.com" target="_blank">too many more</a>, including my own <a href="https://joesepi.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">solo work</a>. Having toured the country and resided in many cities, I have an extensive network of musician friends, several of which have collaborated with me on an upcoming release, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/joesepi/sets/lost-and-found" target="_blank">Lost+Found</a>.\\
